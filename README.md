# Unsupervised Fault Discovery 

Industrial systems require efficient and rapid corrective actions when faults occur. A fault is an abnormality that causes deviation from an expected behavior. When not resolved in a timely manner, faults can damage the equipment and lead to loss in money and time. For example, a broken temperature sensor can indicate that a component's temperature is normal when it is actually off the chart! Sometimes the effect of fault might be catastrophic such as the case of the [Fukushima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_nuclear_accident) and [Deepwater horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon) incidents.
