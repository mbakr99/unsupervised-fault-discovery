# Unsupervised Fault Discovery 

Industrial systems require efficient and rapid corrective actions when faults occur. A fault is an abnormality that causes deviation from an expected behavior. Fault can damage the equipment and lead to loss in money and time when they are not resolved in a timely manner. For example, a broken temperature sensor can indicate that the temperature of a component is normal when it is actually off the chart!
